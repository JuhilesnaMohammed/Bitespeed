# Bitespeed
Bitespeed needs a way to identify and keep track of a customer's identity across multiple purchases.  We know that orders on FluxKart.com will always have either an **`email`** or **`phoneNumber`** in the checkout event.  Bitespeed keeps track of the collected contact information in a relational database table named **`Contact`.**
